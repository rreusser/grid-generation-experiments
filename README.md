# grid-generation-experiments

Playing around with WebGL, web workers, and some math.

See: [http://rickyreusser.com/grid-generation-experiments/](http://rickyreusser.com/grid-generation-experiments/)

The goal of this experiment is to do something fun and nerdy and in the process isolate and extract more and more pieces of the code until this is actually simple, straightforward, extensible, and useful to other people.
